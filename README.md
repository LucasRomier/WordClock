# WordClockSingleLEDStrip

I would like to present a WordClock made with a single LED strip.
The main electronic components are only ESP32 and LED strip. This WordClock uses NTP to automatically adjust the time, so it does not use an RTC module or any buttons. Settings such as time zone and colors can be made through the web interface.
This WordClock is designed to be assembled with a picture frame. It can be arranged in a variety of designs, so please try making it.

See instructables.com for more information.
